# My Notes

I've really struggled with algorithms in the past. I'm definitely not someone
who this comes "easy" to or "thinks in this way". However, I think it's
important to practice and I believe it's something we can get better at with
practice. My goal is to attempt to finish these without looking at other
answers, and then dig into other solutions. When I change my implementations
I'll try to include some notes in here including my initial approach, and how I
learned to do it better.
